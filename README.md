## Support policy

These apps are provided as-is and are not supported by Qlik. Over time, the APIs and
metrics used by the apps may change, so it is advised to monitor each repository

If you have issues while using these apps, support is provided on a best-efforts
basis by contributors to these repositories.

If you have an issue, go to the relevant repository, and:

* Review install guide and FAQs
* Review open and closed issues
* Open a new issue, following the issue template

If you are able to resolve the issue, then close your issue with the resolution,
and if you feel inclined, open a PR with your proposed changes so that we can
consider including the improvement in the next release of the app.

Thank you for your support!
